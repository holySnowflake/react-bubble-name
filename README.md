# React Bubble Name Animation Component

We are making a react component using React and D3. We hope to integrate the two using D3act. The final product will resemble:

We got our inspiration from the following links:

### Current Status
We were not able to complete our original idea due to time constraints so we decided to play around with d3 and see what we could create. We managed to create an interactive bubble animation. We are currently trying to combine our d3 code with React.

### How to run our project
1. Clone the repo
2. npm install
3. npm run dev:build
4. npm run dev:start
5. Go to localhost:8080/bundle
